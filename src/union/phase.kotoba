  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the trade-union analog of `cloud-
  itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- dispute intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds grievance verification +
                                 compliance-flag screening writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:dispute/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 authorize-strike`/`:actuation/
                                 finalize-bargaining-position` NEVER
                                 auto-commit, at any phase.

  `:actuation/authorize-strike`/`:actuation/finalize-bargaining-
  position` are deliberately ABSENT from every phase's `:auto` set,
  including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a rollout
  milestone still to come. Authorizing a real strike action and
  finalizing a real public bargaining position are the two real-world
  legal/collective-action acts this actor performs; both are always a
  human elected-union-leadership call. `union.governor`'s `:actuation/
  authorize-strike`/`:actuation/finalize-bargaining-position` high-
  stakes gate enforces the same invariant independently -- two layers,
  not one, agree on this. `:compliance/screen` is likewise never
  auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same posture every sibling's
  screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only ONE member
  (`:dispute/intake`) -- this domain has no separate no-capital-risk
  'file' lifecycle distinct from the dispute record itself.")
